        Imagine the scene: two prehistoric cave dwellers are sitting by a
        campfire thousands of years ago. One says to the other, ‘Hey, we're
        talking!’ to which the other replies, ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Well, hear me
        out; we don't just growl and gesture, we actually communicate in words
        and whole sentences!’ ‘Wow, you're right! I hadn't even realized. Were
        we doing that yesterday too?’
      </p>
      <p>
        The emergence of language is a unique step in our evolution. What
        brought us to this point? Cooking! Our first and perhaps most important
        invention. About 200,000 years ago, an ingenious ancestor discovered
        that cooking is a way of putting a stomach outside the body, to
        ‘pre-digest’ food before it is eaten. This enabled more calories to be
        ingested in less time, and larger brains to evolve. It’s a shame the
        Nobel Prize didn’t exist back then, because the inventor certainly
        deserved one.
      </p>

        Interestingly, monkeys that eat fruit have relatively more brain
        capacity than monkeys that live on a diet of leaves. The extra energy
        from fruit powers the larger brain. Humans took this a step further.
        With the advent of cooking, we’ve been able to evolve an even larger,
        energy-hungry brain thanks to a smaller gastrointestinal tract.
        Scientists call this the Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis (ETH). Other
        animals don’t cook; cooking has made us human.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        End of the story? Not yet. About 10,000 years ago, our distant ancestors
        made another discovery. Two of them were sitting by a campfire, when one
        said to the other, ‘Are you still wasting your entire days foraging for
        nuts and fruits? You’re way behind the times! You can also put seeds in
        the ground, wait for plants to grow, then harvest them at the end of the
        season.’ This idea spread around the world in no time.

        Agriculture made it possible to settle in one place, and eventually
        develop the complex urban societies we know today. Growing and storing
        food led to the creation of money (grain as a unit of payment), writing
        (keeping track of how much grain you own) and the division of labor (the
        farmer grows the grain, another trades it for the vegetables of a nearby
        tribe, and yet another guards the grain against theft).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our world has now got to the stage where a small number of people
        produce the food that everyone else eats. A world where we can enjoy
        fruits from all seasons from all over the world thanks to our fridges. A
        world where more than half of humanity lives in a city. A world where
        even pigs live in tower blocks. A world where plants are cultivated
        under purple grow lights. And a world where some children believe that
        chocolate milk comes from brown cows. So much has changed since that
        first campfire.

        Imagine how those cave dwellers who once invented cooking would feel if
        they could travel forward in a time machine to your local supermarket.
        They would probably be extremely confused: pre-cut meat in plastic
        packaging, sugar-free chocolate, monster energy drinks, vitamin pills,
        powdered milk. Our ancient ancestors would probably think they had
        landed on another planet. Unlike them, we’re completely used to it, and
        it’s simply part of normal life. However, what’s considered normal is
        continually changing.

        When we think about the future of food, we almost immediately imagine
        technological solutions. Of course, there’s always someone who will
        immediately say it’s ‘unnatural’, but that never tells the whole story.
        Cooking and agriculture were among the first inventions of humankind,
        after all. Time and time again, we devise something new to make our
        lives easier, but which also presents us with new challenges. The first
        person to milk a cow did something perverse by pulling on another
        animal's nipples to extract the mother's milk. These days, this task has
        been allocated to milking robots. So, could we also ‘cultivate’ milk
        without interfering with a cow? Of course! We humans have always come up
        with the strangest creative solutions to the challenges we face. These
        challenges have been ongoing ever since humans first appeared, and new
        ones will continue to arise in the future.

        Will the microwave and air fryer in your kitchen soon be joined by a
        cultivator, in which your meat is grown from animal cells? Or maybe a
        vegan mushroom bioreactor? Will the food processor prepare our food?
        Will everyone eat a personal diet designed by AI, combining nutrition
        and medication? Will we drink coating cola that is not only light, but
        creates a nano-coating on your stomach wall that blocks the absorption
        of all calories consumed for 24 hours? Will we power electronic devices
        in our bodies through food? Will we charge our phones on our own belly
        fat? Will we upgrade our gastrointestinal systems? Or will we take a
        U-turn, and go back to the familiar, unsophisticated agriculture and
        food of our great-grandparents in the future? If so, will we have to do
        back-breaking work in the fields all day, or will we be able to delegate
        this task to solar-powered robots who can do everything without
        fertilizers and pesticides?

        How can we ensure a future in which there’s enough healthy food for
        everyone, without exhausting the soil or even entire ecosystems? What if
        we treat Earth as a scaled-up spaceship, with limited supplies that we
        have to distribute and care for properly? A spaceship in which we work
        together as a harmonious crew on creating a kinder world; for yourself,
        for all other life, and Earth as a whole.
